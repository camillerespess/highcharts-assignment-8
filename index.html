  <h1> School district achievement, spending and poverty rates in North Central Florida </h1>

  <p>By Camille Respess</p>
  <p>In the state of Florida, the Department of Education annually releases data on its public school districts, including spending, test scores and demographics.
    Public school district achievement rates are determined at the end of every academic year by student scores on statewide standard assessments.
    The Florida Department of Education both mandates these examinations and compiles this data.
    The percentages seen in the first graph reflect the number of students in each district in North Central Florida who passed that respective section of the standardized assessment.
    Underneath, a scatter plot compares per pupil funding and poverty rates in the respective counties of these 10 school districts. </p>
